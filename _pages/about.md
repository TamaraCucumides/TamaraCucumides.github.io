About me
======]
My name is Tamara Cucumides and I'm currently a PhD. student in the University of Antwerp, under the guidance of [Floris Geerts](https://fgeerts.github.io/)

My research interest include graph learning, databases, and computational complexity

Hopefully I'll be working on this page anytime soon :)
